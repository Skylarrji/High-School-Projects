#Program Name: Let's Make a Pizza
#Programmer: Skylar Ji
#Purpose: This is an animation using arrays where a pizza is being created (with cheese/other toppings falling down). The pizza then gets put into an oven, gets cooked (the smoke and the pizza dough changes colour as it is being cooked), and gets taken out to be eaten. Arrays are used in the creation of the cheese particles, the pepperoni slices, as well as the smoke and the flames when cooking the pizza.
